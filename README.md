# Project #0: Warming up C Programming

Due: March 21, 23:59

## Overview

This programming assignment is designed for students to warm up your C programming (e.g., parsing strings, pointers, and structures). The students should be fluent in C programming language in order to complete the programming assignments. If not, you should spend extra time learning or reviewing your C coding skills. (Note: in previous semesters, many of the students dropped the classes because of their programming skills...)

Our assignments will be based on the Linux environment which is the most popular operating system in the world. Do not be afraid to use the Linux operating system! Although we do not enforce you to write codes in Linux, it must be properly running in Linux because our evaluation will be carried out on Linux. For those of you who do not have a Linux machine, we create your account on the server running in our department and send you the information. Please check LMS.

## Q & A
Please read carefully the handout file before starting this assignment! If you find any errors in this skeleton code or have a question, leave a post on LMS.
